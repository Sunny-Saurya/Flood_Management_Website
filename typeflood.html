            <br> <br>
            <h3>There are three common types of flooding. By understanding the differences, you can better protect yourself from the next potential flood. </h3><br><br>
            <p>Floods affect more people globally than any other natural hazard. They can cause widespread devastation that can displace people, damage property and critical public infrastructure, and ultimately result in loss of life. And, as the planet continues to warm up due to climate change, the intensity and frequency of flooding is likely to increase. <br><br>“Floods can destroy whole communities and cause billions of dollars of losses. So it’s vital that people, businesses and communities prepare for all flooding eventualities, especially as floods can impact areas located far from water sources,” says Amar Rahman, Global Head of Climate Resilience at Zurich Resilience Solutions. <br><br>There are three common flood types: fluvial floods, also known as river floods; pluvial or flash floods; and coastal floods, which are often called storm surge. Each type of flood occurs and is forecast in different ways. The impacts of each type of flood are also different and so are the actions you need to take to avoid or minimize flooding damage.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

                    <h2>1. Fluvial floods (river floods)</h2>
                    <p>A fluvial, or river flood, occurs when the water level in a river, lake or stream rises and overflows onto the neighboring land. The water level rise of the river could be due to excessive rain or snowmelt.
                        <br><br>
                        The damage from a river flood can be widespread as the overflow affects smaller rivers downstream, which can cause dams and dikes to break and swamp nearby areas.
                    
                        To determine the probability of river flooding, models consider past precipitation, forecasted precipitation, current river levels, as well as soil and terrain conditions.

                    <h2>2. Pluvial floods (flash floods and surface water)</h2>
                    <p>A pluvial flood occurs when an extreme rainfall event creates a flood independent of an overflowing water body. A common misconception about flood is that you must be located near a body of water to be at risk. Yet pluvial flooding can happen in any location, urban or rural, even in areas with no nearby bodies of water.

                    <h2>3. Coastal flood (storm surge)</h2>
                    <p>Coastal flooding is the inundation of land areas along the coast by seawater. Common causes of coastal flooding are intense windstorm events occurring at the same time as high tide (storm surge), and tsunamis.

                        Storm surge is created when high winds from a windstorm force water onshore – this is the leading cause of coastal flooding and often the greatest threat associated with a hurricane or typhoon. The effects increase depending on the tide – windstorms that occur during high tide can result in devastating storm surge floods. In this type of flood, water overwhelms low-lying land and often causes devastating loss of life and property.

                <h3>Record floods in Russia’s Urals triggered by melting snow?</h3> <br>
                <p>
                    Russia declared an emergency in the Orenburg region near Kazakhstan after the Ural River, Europe's third longest river, swelled several metres in hours on Friday, and burst through a dam embankment in the city of Orsk.
                    <br><br>

                    The river, which rises in the Ural Mountains and flows into the Caspian Sea, will reach dangerous levels on Monday in Orenburg, a city of 500,000 down river from Orsk, and the peak is expected there on April 10, Russia’s emergency ministry said.

                <p>Floods caused by heavy rain in the wake of former Tropical Cyclone Jasper cut off several towns popular with tourists in Australia’s northeast along the Great Barrier Reef on Monday, with a crocodile being captured from a storm drain. <br><br>

                    Jasper dumped months’ worth of rain in the far north of Queensland state over the weekend, forcing some people to flee homes and crowd on rooftops to escape fast-rising rivers.</p>

                <h3>Risk of glacial lake outburst floods in ‘Third Pole’ increasing: Study</h3> <br>
                <p>There has been an increase in the occurrence of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) from an average of 1.5 events annually during 1981–1990 to 2.7 during 2011–2020 in the Third Pole region, a study has found. <br><br>

                    The Third Pole, which spans the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding Himalayas, Hindu Kush, and Tianshan Mountain ranges, is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the researchers said.</p>

                <h3>Heavy flooding in southern Myanmar displaces more than 10,000 people</h3> <br>
                <p>Flooding triggered by heavy monsoon rains in Myanmar’s southern areas has displaced more than 10,000 people and disrupted traffic on the rail lines that connect the country’s biggest cities, officials and state-run media said Monday. <br><br>

                    A senior official at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, Lay Shwe Zin Oo, said constant rainfall in the Bago region that began last week caused flooding in the low-lying areas of its capital, Bago township. She said there were no casualties reported so far, but that more than 10,000 people had to abandon their homes.</p>
